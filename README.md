RWA Assignment Project

This is the second repo as I had issues with pushing into it.

I have completed up to task 2 in the new project, and set up github and vercel. Then, I set up MongoDB, made a cluster and conencted it to VSCode with their corresponding extension and .env.local. Afterwards i added the register page and bcrypt login password in MongoDB. Then added the products page with a shopping cart feature
